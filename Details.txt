1. Node JS npm project, so we can install external packages
    1. Create a project for the backend
    2. npm install <package-name>

2. HTTP Server:

    http --> protocol used to serve files or data via internet

    basic server creation using http create server

    Disadvantages:
      http: does not provide wide variety of function to support operations like,

        1. body parsing
        2. changing http methods
        3. handling middlewares
        4. proper routing logic is not possible

      We need to manually handle it with a lots of codes

4. Express:
    APIs using express -
    why express external module:
        basic server creation is possible in normal nodejs that involves lot of code with lots of built-in packages
    
        Express combines everything and puts together in simple terms

    web framework http server applcation which lets us create APIs
    in fast and simple ways

    /teachers - CRUD (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
    /students - CRUD (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)


    Router:

      express.Router(); // sample instance of the server



4.1: POST-Man

    Tool used to access different API Methods like below,
      1. GET
      2. POST
      3. PUT
      4. DELETE

5. CRUD Operations with APIs
   CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

6. URL Params:
    Path Params: /:id

        id or name is the path variable/param
      request.params

      param is *id*
    
    Query Params: comes after question mark
      request.query
      /todos?deleteId=100
      param is *deleteId*

7. Request is an object with pre-defined key<->value pairs & methods/functions

    express request object is different or customized depending on the requirements
    used to operate on top of the request in-coming

    Eg: request.body gives the payload, 
    
    Below are created by expressjs,
      req.params['<param-name>'] gives the path param. request.query will give the query param

8. Resposne:
    response is an object with pre-defined key<->value pairs & methods
    used to operate on top of the response out-going

    Express Created funcs,
      res.send();

    reference: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_response_object.htm

9. Deploying a nodejs application using render.com
      1. Publish codes to Github
      2. Log in render.com
      3. New Web Service
      4. Choose Repo
      5. Configure proper cmds
          1. build cmd ---> npm install
          2. Start Command ---> whatever the script that You want to run
      6. Deploy ( Watch out for any errors in the deployment process)



10.                          DB Connection ---> MongoDB 

    Step 1:
      Connection to a DB
    Step 2: 
      Write Queries to do CRUD opertion with DB

    to connect to any DB We need driver setup for any language

    Packages:
      MongoDB -> Simple Connecting to DB and writing ontop of the database
    
11. Converting the Local variable to Local DB
        local memory storing will loose the data after server restart

        but local DB Data will be persisted locally in the machine - Done
        

12.                                   Cloud DB:
      1. Cloud Atlas:

        Signing Up & Creating Cloud DB

        Connecting with Cloud Atlas DB
      
        DB Create: 
          1. Sign up on https://cloud.mongodb.com/
          2. Cluster Creation
          3. Database Creation ( Select M0 Free Version & Create )
          4. Username with Password, Note those details somewhere safe
          5. Add 0.0.0.0/0 in the network - this open up the db for anybody with username/password to connect to it
          5. Copy the Connect URL and replace with the local url
